Pretty Scale – AI Attractiveness Test

<a href="https://prettyscale.io">Pretty Scale</a> is an interactive, AI-powered web tool designed to analyze facial attractiveness using advanced face landmark detection. With a single photo upload, the tool provides users with an instant beauty score, offering a fun and engaging way to explore facial symmetry and proportion.

In a world increasingly shaped by AI and digital experiences, Pretty Scale offers a playful take on the age-old question: "Am I attractive?" Our tool doesn't claim to define beauty universally, but it does offer a data-driven perspective rooted in facial geometry. By analyzing the distances and alignment between key facial landmarks—like the eyes, lips, chin, and ears—Pretty Scale generates a visual score that reflects how closely your facial structure aligns with commonly referenced ideals of symmetry.

The process is simple: users upload a clear photo of their face, and within seconds, the AI evaluates several features. These include the balance between the eyes, the vertical alignment of the lips, the relative length of the chin, the width between the ears, and the overall facial symmetry. The tool then calculates individual category scores and a composite “overall” beauty score, visualized in a user-friendly interface.

Importantly, Pretty Scale is designed with inclusivity and entertainment in mind. It’s not about enforcing narrow standards of beauty or promoting unrealistic ideals. Instead, it encourages curiosity and self-reflection through the lens of AI. Everyone’s face is unique, and Pretty Scale celebrates that uniqueness while providing a lighthearted way to engage with facial analysis.

Whether you're simply curious, want to test how a new photo fares, or just enjoy experimenting with AI tools, Pretty Scale offers a seamless and mobile-friendly experience. The interface is clean and accessible, designed to work well across devices. On mobile or desktop, users can expect fast, reliable results with no technical setup or app installation required.

While the beauty score is calculated using measurable data points, we emphasize that the results are not a judgment or diagnosis. They're generated from mathematical calculations—not social perceptions, personality, or style. Beauty, after all, is deeply personal and shaped by culture, emotion, and individuality. Pretty Scale merely adds a modern, AI-powered dimension to the conversation.

Whether you’re trying it alone or sharing results with friends for fun, Pretty Scale is meant to entertain, inform, and spark conversation. Users should approach it with an open mind and a sense of humor, appreciating both the tech behind it and the opportunity to explore self-image in a new way.

In a digital age where selfies and facial filters are everywhere, Pretty Scale adds a thoughtful, interactive twist. It combines the accessibility of a web tool with the intrigue of artificial intelligence—all aimed at creating an engaging user experience centered on you.

Try it for yourself, and see how your photo scores—not for validation, but for curiosity. Your face tells a story, and Pretty Scale simply helps you explore one angle of that story through the lens of AI.
